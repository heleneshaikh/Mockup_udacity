You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I'm already quite familiar with HTML and CSS. However, I now learned how to draw a horizontal line using <hr>, a tag I've never used before.
* It was all quite easy, it's not my first time writing HTML documents.
* Nothing was difficult so far.
* I did not know how to draw a horizontal line, but the documentation certainly helped me with that!
